# Unexpected Behavior with calc() in CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue that can arise when using the `calc()` function in CSS to dynamically calculate widths, particularly when the parent element's width is not explicitly defined.  Some browsers handle this situation inconsistently, leading to unexpected results.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code.  The `bugSolution.css` file provides a solution to mitigate the issue.  The solution involves ensuring the parent element has a defined width, or using alternative methods such as viewport units (vw) or percentages that are less prone to these kinds of interpretation errors.

This issue highlights the importance of thorough cross-browser testing and careful consideration of how CSS calculations interact with the page layout.
