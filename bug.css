The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

The `calc()` function is used to calculate the width of the div. However, some browsers may incorrectly interpret the calculation if the parent element has a width that is not specified explicitly.
